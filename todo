1. New DBO's for:

a. Messgaes
b. CSS/JS
c. Registry
d. Files

2. Get rid of Module models.

3. Finish Display Controller

a. Parser
b. Includers
c. Controller(Display) - Views

* * * * Questions  * * * *

Components and Modules - same thing? Name? Widget?

* * * * Event Layer * * * *

Events are registered with the Events Service.

Only the Application and Controller processes can fire events

Extensions schedule events to participate
Services::Event()->schedule('OnBeforeSave')

Triggers register for scheduled events.
Services::Event()->schedule('OnBeforeSave')

The Application and Controller classes notify the Event Manager at Event Time
Services::Event()->notify('OnBeforeSave')

The Event Service triggers those registered
Services::Event()->trigger('OnBeforeSave')

Typically, triggers interact with Services which interfaces to the Utility layer:
- Services::Mail()->Send
- Services::Filter()->text
- Services::Model()->getItems


* * * * Services Layer (Middleware) * * * *

AssetService
Specific focus on JS and CSS; interface with minimizers, etc.
Remove all specifically coded paths from code - instead use the Asset Manager API
No Services::Filesystem anywhere but the AssetService (Also, see Model)
Same for views
Bring in the php spl priority

AuthenticationService - Events for Login, etc

Filter - get HTML Purifier in

ModelService
Only interface to Models should go thru this the ModelService
-- It should look for overrides, etc.
-- It should replace EntryModel
-- Instead of having a Head and Message and Request Model, abstract out the data access
element and create a "DBO" of sorts to those types of data.
-- Same for media (files - including CSS, JS, Images, and so forth)
-- Models remaining: Model (base), Item (crud), and Display (list)
-- All customization, editing, and so forth, defined with Table XML and Triggers
