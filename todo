* * * * Model / DB interaction * * * *

1. New data_sources for:

Develop standard API to the DB

a. Messages
b. Head data (CSS/JS)
c. Registry (Parameters - like head and footer and the grid)
d. File system

2. Get rid of Module models - fold those into the same model thing.

3. Finish Display Controller

a. Parser
b. Includers
c. Controller(Display) - Views

ModelService
Only interface to Models should go thru this the ModelService
-- It should look for overrides, etc.
-- It should replace EntryModel
-- Instead of having a Head and Message and Request Model, abstract out the data access
element and create a "DBO" of sorts to those types of data.
-- Same for media (files - including CSS, JS, Images, and so forth)
-- Models remaining: Model (base), Item (crud), and Display (list)
-- All customization, editing, and so forth, defined with Table XML and Triggers

* * * * Services Layer (Middleware) * * * *

AssetService
Specific focus on JS and CSS; interface with minimizers, etc.
Remove all specifically coded paths from code - instead use the Asset Manager API
No Services::Filesystem anywhere but the AssetService (Also, see Model)
Same for views
Bring in the php spl priority

AuthenticationService - Events for Login, etc

Filter - get HTML Purifier in
